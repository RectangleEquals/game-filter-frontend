# Game Filter

A social web application to centralize, filter, rate and compare video games.

The goal of this app is to help individual groups of people determine which games might be worth trying out, based on live data and an overall social average of personal preferences (such as how new the game is, which platform(s) it's on, how many players it supports, does it have controller support, what do others in my social group think about it, etc).

Discord integration is used to identify users, their initial "groups" (based on server), and each member's individual gaming preferences to help filter out all the noise of finding that next big game to play.<br/><br/>

# Supported Distribution Platforms

Support for both Xbox Game Pass (PC, Console & Cloud) and possible support for Steam are planned.<br/>
The Epic Games Store may or may not see some (very) limited support in the distant future.
